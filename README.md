# Wyser Browser

A concept browser application made using Java and JavaFX

## Motivation

I created this project as a concept idea of a browser that is unique and works in a different way as compared to the conventional browsers out there.

## Tech/framework used

  - Java
  - JavaFX
  
## Features

  - Can detect if the user has given the address ending with a domain and if present directly opens the website.
  - If a general search term is entered, a side pane with popular websites is shown and user can seamlessly browse every site without having to visit the sites individually.
  - A Wyser search feature which on click will return the most relevant website for that search term.
  
## Future Enhancements

  - Can include a database system to store the browser history
  - Can implement the web engine using Chromium instead of the slower WebView of Java.
